# Create-and-Download-Zip-file-using-PHP
Creating .ZIP archives using PHP can be just as simple as creating them on your desktop. PHP's ZIP class provides all the functionality you need! To make the process a bit faster for you, I've coded a simple create_zip function for you to use on your projects.

The function accepts an array of files, the name of the destination files, and whether or not you'd like the destination file to be overwritten if a file of the same name exists. The function returns true if the file was created, false if the process runs into any problems.
